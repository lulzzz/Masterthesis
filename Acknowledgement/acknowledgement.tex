First and foremost, I would like to thank all my colleagues at SAP with whom I was working in the Retail Omni-Channel Consumer Industries department and especially the manager Simona Dumitru who gave me the opportunity to work on this project. I would also like to thank Owen Hickey and Baris Yalcin for their supervision during the project. I truly appreciate their willingness to answer all my questions, provide input and discuss the project. In addition I would like to thank Professor Barbara Sprick and Professor Gerd Moeckel for their assistance and suggestions throughout the course of this study. It was a pleasure for me to work with all these people.
